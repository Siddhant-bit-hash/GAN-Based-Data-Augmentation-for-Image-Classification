To train GANs, run train_gans.py and modify the parameters in the main function (train_size, trial, alpha, num_gans). Ensure that the trial isnâ€™t already used unless you want to overwrite the previous data. Then, train the classifier by running train_classifier.py and modifying the parameters in the main function (num_real, num_synth, alpha, epoch). Finally, check the saved model path.
